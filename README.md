## faqMan

faqMan is a simple FAQ Manager for MODx Revolution. Questions/Answers are
modified through the backend manager and displayed on the front-end by a
snippet with customizable chunks.

## Getting started

Install however you please, but using the Revo package manager is encouraged.

Once installed you will need to create at least one FAQ Set. Once created, you
can right click on a set and select 'Manage FAQ Set' to start adding questions
and answers.

To display your FAQ's on your side, simply call
[[!faqMan? &set=`yourSetIdHere`]] (replacing yourSetIdHere with the ID of the
set you wish to display). If you do not select a set, all FAQ's will be
displayed and grouped first by set then their rank in each set.
